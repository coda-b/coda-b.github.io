## Intro
Out at the University of Arizona in their university newspaper called "[Arizona Daily Wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Daily_Wildcat)" were posted several unordinary articles. 
Since early 1970's on every May 1st (which is also called May Day or Law Day) and at other seemingly various random times during the year and lasts for the last 40 years, unknwown persons or a secret organisation, who's also was related somehow to campus, been posting advertisements in the university newspaper. 

In brief they consist of in depth references to world history, world geography, higher mathematics and sciences, current and ancient world wide languages, ancient events, world religions of today and back into antiquity, puzzles and riddles, and an as yet undiscovered "mysterious treasure of untold wealth".

[Brayan D. Hence](http://maydaymystery.org/mayday/webmaster.html) âˆ’ ex-web-master of [Wildcat](http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu), noticed these advertisements and tried to track something, which also happens now too. 

His conclusions he leaves on his [web-page](http://www.maydaymystery.org/mayday/texts/index.html)

## History 
A brief retelling.

In 1994 Brayan came to Tucson, from Ohio to attend college at the University of Arizona. 
He was an employee of the Daily Wildcat in the middle to late 1990's, he was majoring in Journalism and minoring in computer science at the time. 
Later then he started to notice these mysterious cryptic advertisements and soon began checking all around campus for more information on what this might possibly mean, and also who have possibly written them.

>My freshman year was full of everything it should be, of new experiences and faces and sensations. I was alive with ignorant bliss found only in the eyes of a freshman. I lived life.

These advertisements soon got him very curious, so he quickly started collecting them, painstakingly scanned them onto a computer and post this on his first serious comprehensive information website for deeper analysis of the entire mystery.
It also soon drew an attention of another student who has proved very elusive not only then, but over the years since that time by the name of Winston Reynolds.

>I entered the Game.

Very soon afterwards, the records show that Winston Reynolds suddenly began making regular trips overseas. 

>Winston Reynolds was a really top student, and has to be one of the smartest guys I have ever met. He had this strange chrisma that kind of attracted you if he got close to you like he had magnets in his pockets or something, and no matter what subject came up in a campus conversation he seemed to always have had at least some personal experience to draw from about it. He just always seemed like he was mentally some place else, and holding some great untold unknown secrets.
 
Mysteriously, Winston Reynolds seemingly completely vanished only a few hours after his graduation ceremony at the University of Arizona. Over the years although allegedly living in one area or another according to reports and eye witness sightings his actual whereabouts to this day remain completely unknown. 

Bryan continues his research by now. (?) 


## More on riddles
The game seems to revolve around May 1st, usually known as May Day. 
The solution to these puzzles is to unravel a series of complex, detailed and intertwining pages that are printed every May 1st in "Arizona Daily Wildcat" newspaper. In addition there are rare "corrective" pages that work with seemingly random and unrelated dates which "update" the state of the game. Such advertisements are usually short, mysterious and seek to change part of the existing Mayday page to reflect the necessary changes inside the game. 
I.e. One such page gives alternative coordinates with an apologetic tone.  
Each page consists of several tips, keywords and dates as well as other dates and page numbers associated with other Mayday pages, which can be found in the latest issues of the original university newspaper. 
So it seems that these pages are closely related to each other.

>I conducted a thorough search to dig out as many pages of the May day as possible, and I carefully analyzed them. I was at a dead end. I do not know all the vague languages and symbols.

What led him to
* Someone is doing his history homework: there is a lot of vague historical information based on references to historical, religious and other sources, on objects and events, historical significance for the solution of the game.
* Someone is doing his math homework: Once again, the stranger symbols and many more. Starting from physics and ending with chemistry and binary encodings, clues come in every version and form. The autor of the game seems to be fond of cryptography and anything like... 
* Someone has surplus of money to spark interest in these riddles: full screen advertisements in "The Daily Wildcat" are not cheap and their publications have been working for over 10 years. This makes him to believe that they (autor(s)?) are in age, or well estabilished professionals.
* The author of this game is familiar with Tucson and the Arizona's University campus: As he said earlier, this is a semi-local game, but you can't say this until you really get the key for understanding.
* All this involves a deliberate, organized effort to carefully constuct a puzzle leading to some end point (or dead end perhaps). He guarantees that the Mayday pages are not the work of mentally illed person and / or madman at all.
* UPD: I take the above statement back. They may be a completely abnormal, but as of 1.15.99 he believes that they are at least some sort of interesting ones and deserve some attention, regardless of their intentions. They are to systematic, too accurate and, as he said, they are rich.


>[Here](http://www.maydaymystery.org/mayday/texts/index.html) are all of the texts I've managed to get my hands on. I have Xeroxed and scanned each one in, transforming them into HTML to facilitate clue-gathering and referencing...
>The largest of these pages should be ~300k, but they average ~100k

Students, who worked at "The Daily Wildcat", say that the May Day articles are sent then through the mail, although some have been submitted through different, random, temporary emails. 

Although nobody has found out what all of this nonsense means, The May Day mystery has only just begun.
