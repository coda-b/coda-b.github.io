## What is
In our unsecure digital world everyone can be a leet hacker who might also asked himself the question: How does it work?
It's an easy task today to make a valnurable service and not so easy find a suitable exploit for it. 
Also to defend itself from others intruders might be the same hard as being one. 
Learning how do things work makes things lots easier for understanding and adds you an additional line of your skills to your résumé.  

Every todays exploit is build up from shellcodes. 
Shellcodes are built up from machine code which was generated using assembly language. 
C programming language is famous for it's turing completeness and low level configureation which leds us to use it as an example. 
C is written in assembly language so it's not surprising.
All books about C programming language, following the ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogeny principle of language instruction, start their discussion of C memory menagment. 
Suppose that I'll too.
