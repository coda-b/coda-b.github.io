  <h1>Ego</h1>
  <p>
    I am a demiromantic, genderfluid, and a heaping pile of trash cleverly arranged to appear to be a human being. I tackle on challenging problems and try to solve them with code. I'm interested in physics and AI.
    I also don't care about pronouns, so you can refer to me in whatever way you want to.
